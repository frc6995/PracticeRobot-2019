Goal:
	To make the robot climb. Using two double solenoids and a single motor.
Inputs:
	User input to start
	User input to cancel
	Limit switch on the front legs
	Limit switch on the back legs

Outputs:
	Deploy front
	Retract front
	Deploy Back
	Retract Back
	Leg Motor movement forward/backward

Constraints:
	No turning
	Need to use commands or command groups
	Command groups can only call commands
	There is distance between the wheel and bumpers.
	Double solenoids
	Climb algorithm expects a start position

Algorithm
	Hardware Objects:
		Sendors:
		* Movement Motor is                             mMotor
		* Double Solenoid Front Right is                dblSolenoidFrontRight
		* Double Solenoid Front Left is                 dblSolenoidFrontLeft
		* Double Solenoid Back Right is                 dblSolenoidRearRight
		* Double Solenoid Back Left is                  dblSolenoidRearLeft
		Sensors:
		* Ultrasonic Sensor Front is                    ultSensorFront
		* Ultrasonic Sensor Back is                     ultSensorMiddle
		* Limit switch Front piston regulator is        limPosFront
		* Limit switch Rear piston regulator is         limPosRear

	Create Variable Managers (Methods):
		* Regulates motor speed                         legWheels(paramaters speed,timeout)
		* Deploys all pistons                           deploy()
		* Retracts front pistons                        retractFront()
		* Retracts rear pistons                         retractRear()
		* Retracts all pistons                          retract()

	Create robot state variables (booleans):
		* Ultrasonic bumper sensor is                   frontIsOver()
		* Ultrasonic center of gravity sensor is        centerIsOver()
		* Ultrasonic height sensor                      height(paramaters altitude)
		* Limit switch front piston retracted regulator frontPistons()
		* Limit switch rear piston retracted regulator  rearPistons()

	Driver has initiated climb (button):
		a. Calls deploy() method
		b. Calls legWheels() until frontIsOver() returns true or timed out
		c. Calls retractFront(), until frontPistons() returns true
		d. Calls legWheels() until centerIsOver() returns true or timed out
		e. Calls retractRear(), until RearPistons() returns true
		f. Driver manually moves forward rest of way

	Driver has canceled climb (button):
		a. Get Value of frontPistons(), if true, ignore cancellation
		b. Call legWheels() to move backwards until timed out
		c. Call Retract()
