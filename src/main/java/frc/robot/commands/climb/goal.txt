Goal:
	To make the robot climb. Using two double solenoids and a single motor.
Inputs:
	User input to start
	User input to cancel
	Limit switch on the front legs
	Limit switch on the back legs

Outputs:
	Deploy front
	Retract front
	Deploy Back
	Retract Back
	Leg Motor movement forward/backward

Constraints:
	No turning
	Need to use commands or command groups
	Command groups can only call commands
	There is distance between the wheel and bumpers.
	Double solenoids
	Climb algorithm expects a start position

Maximum Algorithm
	Hardware Objects:
		Sendors:
			* Movement Motor is                            mMotor
			* Double Solenoid Front is                     dblSolenoidF
			* Double Solenoid Rear is                      dblSolenoidR

		Sensors:
			* Ultrasonic Sensor Right Front Bumper is      ultSensorFR
			* Ultrasonic Sensor Left Front Bumper is       ultSensorFL
			* Ultrasonic Sensor Front is                   ultSensorF
			* Ultrasonic Sensor Rear is                    ultSensorR
			* Limit switch dblSolenoidF position sensor is limSolenoidPosF
			* Limit switch dblSolenoidR position sensor is limSolenoidPosR

	Create robot state variables (booleans):
		* Ultrasonic Sensor Right Front is               ultSensorFR
		* Ultrasonic Sensor Left Front is                ultSensorFL
		* Limit switch Front solenoid position sensor is limSolenoidPosF
		* Limit switch Rear solenoid position sensor is  limSolenoidPosR
		* mMotor is Running is                           motorState

	Driver has initiated climb (button) and has not canceled climb
		a. Deploys dblSolenoidF and dblSolenoidR
		b. moves mMotor until ultSensorF returns true
		c. retracts dblSolenoidF while mMotor is running and limSolenoidPosF returns true
		d. proceeds to move mMotor until ultSensorR returns true
		e. stops mMotor
		f. retracts dblSolenoidR and limSolenoidPosR returns true sending signal to 
		   Driver via shuffleboard that it is safe to move forward

	Driver has canceled climb
		a. get limSolenoidPosF
		b. move mMotor backwards until ultSensorFR or ultSensorFL return true
		c. move mMotor backwards for small amount of time
		d. retract dblSolenoidF and dblSolenoidR
